### FoodTruckProject

#### Description
This is a program designed to store 'food trucks' as objects in to an array. We have a menu that allows the user to list the trucks, check for the highest rated truck, and see what the average rating is for all trucks.  

#### Lessons Learned
I had issues with the scanner primarily. I spent too much time on constructing and checking the array itself, but I learned some lessons on storing and accessing arrays of objects. I wanted to check the user input for rating 0.0 - 5.0, but I hit a snag with a while true loop in the main method. I'll try again by putting this logic in the setter and getter for this attribute and that should work, but alas, I am out of time for the day and I don't think this is a graded element.
